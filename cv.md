# About me
I am 21 years old, currently I am a 3rd year student at SPbSUT majoring in Software Engineering. It took me a long time to decide on the direction of my development in this area, but at the end of last year I finally realized that I was interested in the frontend. I have also always dreamed of traveling the world and I hope working as a frontend developer will help me achieve this.  That's why I'm here.
